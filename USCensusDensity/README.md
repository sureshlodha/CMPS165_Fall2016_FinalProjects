# CensusTractsMap

A topojson file of the United States' 50 states and DC, with geometries for both counties and census tracts.

Includes versions both of the original spherical coordinates, and a cartesian projection using d3.geoAlbersUsa().

A population density map is shown as an example at: https://nathanohara222.github.io/CensusTractsMap/

Created with d3.js and topojson.

Shape data from: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html

Census data from: http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml
